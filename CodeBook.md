Code Book File: Explaining Data Manipulation and Thought Process

First, I will list the variable names for the 'final_tidy' data frame that is produced by 'run_analysis.R':

"Subject.ID", "Activity.Label", "t Body Acc mean X", "t Body Acc mean Y", "t Body Acc mean Z", "t Gravity Acc mean X", "t Gravity Acc mean Y", "t Gravity Acc mean Z", "t Body Acc Jerk mean X", "t Body Acc Jerk mean Y", "t Body Acc Jerk mean Z","t Body Gyro mean X", "t Body Gyro mean Y", "t Body Gyro mean Z", "t Body Gyro Jerk mean X", "t Body Gyro Jerk mean Y", "t Body Gyro Jerk mean Z", "t Body Acc Mag mean", "t Gravity Acc Mag mean", "t Body Acc Jerk Mag mean", "t Body Gyro Mag mean", "t Body Gyro Jerk Mag mean", "f Body Acc mean X", "f Body Acc mean Y", "f Body Acc mean Z", "f Body Acc mean Freq X", "f Body Acc mean Freq Y", "f Body Acc mean Freq Z", "f Body Acc Jerk mean X", "f Body Acc Jerk mean Y", "f Body Acc Jerk mean Z", "f Body Acc Jerk mean Freq X", "f Body Acc Jerk mean Freq Y", "f Body Acc Jerk mean Freq Z", "f Body Gyro mean X", "f Body Gyro mean Y", "f Body Gyro mean Z", "f Body Gyro mean Freq X", "f Body Gyro mean Freq Y", "f Body Gyro mean Freq Z", "f Body Acc Mag mean", "f Body Acc Mag mean Freq", "f Body Body Acc Jerk Mag mean", "f Body Body Acc Jerk Mag mean Freq", "f Body Body Gyro Mag mean", "f Body Body Gyro Mag mean Freq", "f Body Body Gyro Jerk Mag mean", "f Body Body Gyro Jerk Mag mean Freq", "anglet Body Acc Mean,gravity", "anglet Body Acc Jerk Mean,gravity Mean", "anglet Body Gyro Mean,gravity Mean", "anglet Body Gyro Jerk Mean,gravity Mean", "angle X,gravity Mean", "angle Y,gravity Mean", "angle Z,gravity Mean", "t Body Acc std X", "t Body Acc std Y", "t Body Acc std Z", "t Gravity Acc std X", "t Gravity Acc std Y", "t Gravity Acc std Z", "t Body Acc Jerk std X", "t Body Acc Jerk std Y", "t Body Acc Jerk std Z", "t Body Gyro std X", "t Body Gyro std Y", "t Body Gyro std Z", "t Body Gyro Jerk std X", "t Body Gyro Jerk std Y", "t Body Gyro Jerk std Z", "t Body Acc Mag std", "t Gravity Acc Mag std", "t Body Acc Jerk Mag std", "t Body Gyro Mag std", "t Body Gyro Jerk Mag std", "f Body Acc std X", "f Body Acc std Y", "f Body Acc std Z", "f Body Acc Jerk std X", "f Body Acc Jerk std Y", "f Body Acc Jerk std Z", "f Body Gyro std X", "f Body Gyro std Y", "f Body Gyro std Z", "f Body Acc Mag std", "f Body Body Acc Jerk Mag std", "f Body Body Gyro Mag std", and "f Body Body Gyro Jerk Mag std"

The first variable, 'Subject.ID' reports the identidy of the subject for a particular observation (This ID is unique, and comes fomr either the original 'train' or 'test' data sets).  The second variable, 'Activity.Label' reports the particular activity (Walking, Sitting, etc.) that a certain subject was being tested under for a particular observation/row.  The rest of the variables report the AVERAGE of the particular feature/test that the Samsung technology was recording for the particular subject/activty combination.  They have been cleaned up from the original column titles, such that there are spaces that allows for ease of readability and differentiation between the 't and f' and the 'X, Y, and Z' portions of the Samsung recording.

The data (180 observations by 88 variables) is presented such that 'Subject.ID' is an integer from 1 - 30, labeling the particular subject under study, 'Activity.Label' is a factor of 6 levels ranging from Sitting, Walaking, etc., and the rest of the data set is made up of numeric numbers.

The 'run_analysis.R' code contains comments informing the reader about the purpose of each part of the code, but I will describe, briefly, what the analysis entailed and my thought process for tidiness:

1.) I loaded the activity labels and feature labels, to be used to identify what activity each sucbject was under when tested, and to identify the readings of each feature of the SAmsung technology during those observations.  Furthermore, I loaded up the 'train' and 'test' data, which included the actual data, activity labels, and subject IDs.

2.)
